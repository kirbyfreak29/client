This app is for college students and people who are new to the ways of the kitchen. Some may know how to cook a few meals, but this app will enable them to coordinate with housemates to effectively manage a wider variety of dishes to create complete and maybe even complex meals. Some apps provide a shopping list, some provide recipes, some may even provide reminders and tips for cooking, but none have brought all these features together. This one convenient app would combine a searchable, sortable, editable recipe book (in which you could add notes about modifications), shopping lists, weekly meal plans, reminders (such as when to start thawing meat or set crockpots), and would even notify you when perishable foods are about to expire. 

So whether we've got your support or not, we hope we've provided... Food for Thought.
